# Please refer to the [Tutorial](https://diataxis.fr/tutorials/) section of the diataxis framework.
# Unlike the other documentation sections, Tutorials are written as scripts, then
# automatically processed into markdown files and Jupyter notebooks
# using the Literate.jl package. This functionality is implemented in make_tutorials.jl.
